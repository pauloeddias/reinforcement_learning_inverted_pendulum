# reinforcement_learning_inverted_pendulum
The files for the implementation of the inverted pendulum controller using reinforcement learning as in my LinkedIn article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inverted-pendulum-controller-using-reinforcement-learning-paulo-silva/

In order to get this working, you must first install the following Python packages:

numpy
tensorflow
gym
keras
keras-rl


I used Python 3.6 for this and haven't tested with other versions.
